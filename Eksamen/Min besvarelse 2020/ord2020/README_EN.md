# Exam TDT4100 Spring 2020

The exam is split in two, with several tasks in each:

- [Part 1](src/stuff/README_EN.md) is made up of separate challenges, each testing different parts of the curriculum. In total they make up 25% of the exam.
- [Part 2](src/food/README_EN.md) contains a larger programming exercise, with five tasks. In total these make up 75% of the exam.

Remember that it is easy to get lost in trying to make perfect code. Don't spend too much time on each task - you will get a better total score by finishing 80% of three tasks than 100% on one and not have time for the others. If you fail to implement a method, you can of course use it as if it worked when you work on the rest of the exam (like it was a paper exam).

All tasks are described in text, but this doesn't necessarily contain all information. For a breakdown of requirements for a method, consult the javadoc above the method itself. The javadoc for a method is a comment in front of the method in the source code, explaining the functionality. 

## Delivery
When you are ready to deliver your exam, your project folder needs to be zipped and uploaded to Inspera. You can prepare the zip file like this:

**Zipping in Windows**
- Right-click the project icon in the leftmost 'Package Explorer' window in Eclipse.
- Choose 'Show in' -> click 'System Explorer'.
- You should now have a System Explorer window (not in Eclipse) open in a folder that most likely ends with 'git', for me it is 'C:\Users\borgeha\git'. The folder we want to compress is the project folder inside this git folder.
- Right click the project folder ord2020 -> Send to  -> Compressed (zipped) folder.
- Windows now compresses this folder into the git folder, and asks you to name it. Leave it as it is.
- This zip file is the one you shall upload to Inspera.
- You'll find a couple of screen shots of the process below.

**Zipping in OS X**
- Follow the same guideline as for Windows above, but instead chose to open in 'Finder'.
- Inside the Finder, right click the food_2020 and choose 'Compress'
- The resulting file is the one you upload to Inspera.
